<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

A simple wrapper around git worktree operations, create, switch, and delete.
There is some assumed workflow within this plugin, but pull requests are
welcomed to fix that).

## Quick Links

## Prerequisites

### Required

-   `neovim >= 0.9`
-   `plenary.nvim`

### Optional

-   [`telescope.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

## Installation

This plugin is [available on LuaRocks][luarocks-url]:

```lua
{
  'polarmutex/git-worktree.nvim',
  version = '^2',
  dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }
}
```

## Quick Setup

This plugin does not require to call setup function

## Features

## Usage

Three primary functions should cover your day-to-day.

The path can be either relative from the git root dir or absolute path to the worktree.

```lua
-- Creates a worktree.  Requires the path, branch name, and the upstream
-- Example:
require("git-worktree").create_worktree("feat-69", "master", "origin")

-- switches to an existing worktree.  Requires the path name
-- Example:
require("git-worktree").switch_worktree("feat-69")

-- deletes to an existing worktree.  Requires the path name
-- Example:
require("git-worktree").delete_worktree("feat-69")
```

## Advanced Configuration

to modify the default configuration, set `vim.g.git_worktree`.

-   See [`:help git-worktree.config`](./doc/git-worktree.txt) for a detailed
    documentation of all available configuration options.

```lua
vim.g.git_worktree = {
    ...
}
```

### Hooks

Yes! The best part about `git-worktree` is that it emits information so that you
can act on it.

```lua
local Hooks = require("git-worktree.hooks")

Hooks.register(Hooks.type.SWITCH, Hooks.builtins.update_current_buffer_on_switch)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> -   **no** builtins are registered
>     by default and will have to be registered

This means that you can use [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
or other plugins to perform follow up operations that will help in turbo
charging your development experience!

### Telescope Config<a name="telescope-config"></a>

In order to use [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) as a UI,
make sure to add `telescope` to your dependencies and paste this following snippet into your configuration.

```lua
require('telescope').load_extension('git_worktree')
```

### Debugging<a name="debugging"></a>

git-worktree writes logs to a `git-worktree-nvim.log` file that resides in Neovim's cache path. (`:echo stdpath("cache")` to find where that is for you.)

By default, logging is enabled for warnings and above. This can be changed by setting `vim.g.git_worktree_log_level` variable to one of the following log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`. Note that this would have to be done **before** git-worktree's `setup` call. Alternatively, it can be more convenient to launch Neovim with an environment variable, e.g. `> GIT_WORKTREE_NVIM_LOG=trace nvim`. In case both, `vim.g` and an environment variable are used, the log level set by the environment variable overrules. Supplying an invalid log level defaults back to warnings.

### Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If the upstream is not setup correctly when trying to pull or push, make sure the following command returns what is shown below. This seems to happen with the gitHub cli.

```lua
git config --get remote.origin.fetch

+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

if it does not run the following

```bash
git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
```
